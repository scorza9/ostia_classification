# ostia_classification
This work aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) fully automatic framework working on CCTA images that will be able to map the coronary artery tree.
The goal is for the network to recognize whether a node that belongs to the coronary artery tree is a coronary ostium, which is the interface between the aorta and the coronary artery.
